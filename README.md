Modal Window Project is a simple interactive UI component built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It demonstrates how to open and close a modal window using buttons and keyboard events. The modal is triggered by clicking any "Show Modal" button, and it can be closed by clicking the close button, clicking the overlay, or pressing the Escape key. The project focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with CSS classes to control visibility.

This project was created based on The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!
